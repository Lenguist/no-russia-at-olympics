**Subject:** Suspilne investigation: war veterans in Russian Paralympic pipeline — Bucha unit link

Tariq,

Following your piece today on Russia's return to the Paralympics, I wanted to flag a Suspilne investigation published today (Feb 18) that adds a significant dimension to the story.

**The headline finding:** The Russian Paralympic Committee president Pavel Rozhkov stated in his 2026 New Year's address that approximately 500 participants in the war against Ukraine are now part of Russian Paralympic teams. Suspilne's investigative editorial office has identified and profiled 10 of them.

**The detail that matters most:** One of them — Tsyden Geninov, 29, a lieutenant and Russian archery champion — served in the **5th Guards Tank Brigade** (military unit 46108). This is the unit identified by Ukrainian authorities as directly involved in the Bucha massacre. Geninov was awarded in the Kremlin in February 2025 and won the CISM World Championship in Tehran in October 2025. He is nominated for Russia's best athlete of 2025.

**Other profiles include:**
- Denis Ishbulatov, Lt. Colonel from the 106th Airborne Tula Division, which participated in the Kyiv offensive. Now a leading Russian para shooter and Russian Cup winner.
- Ruslan Ustyuzhin, 31st Airborne Brigade, who Russian social media indicates participated in the battle for Hostomel airport. Now aiming for the sitting volleyball team.
- Anton Bushmakin, a marine sapper wounded near Avdiivka, who said in a January 2026 documentary: "I am ready to compete under my flag, under the anthem, and to win. This is the goal: to get first place at the Paralympics."

**The institutional angle:** Rozhkov has documented this escalation himself. In March 2023, he said Paralympic athletes were visiting military hospitals. By 2024, he was publicly including veterans in teams. By 2026, he claims 500. The RPC describes channeling military personnel into major sport as "one of the most important areas of their activities."

**Correction to note:** Suspilne confirmed that none of the 6 athletes actually invited to Milan are former military. The veterans are in the broader teams, reserves, and pipeline. But the RPC's own statements make clear this is an institutional program, not individual cases.
