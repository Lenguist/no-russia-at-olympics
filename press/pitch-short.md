**Subject:** Sourced: Russian Paralympic pipeline includes soldier from Bucha unit

Hi [name],

Suspilne (Ukrainian public broadcaster) published an investigation today identifying war veterans in Russia's Paralympic teams. The Russian Paralympic Committee president claims ~500 war veterans are now in their teams.

The strongest finding: one athlete — Lt. Tsyden Geninov, now Russia's top para-archer — served in the 5th Guards Tank Brigade, the unit implicated in the Bucha massacre. He was awarded in the Kremlin and won the 2025 CISM World Championship.

Other profiles include veterans from the 106th Airborne (Kyiv offensive), the 31st Airborne (Hostomel airport battle), and multiple volunteers from the 2022 invasion.

None of the 6 athletes invited to Milan are former military. The veterans are in the broader team/reserves — but the RPC calls this pipeline "one of the most important areas of their activities."

# Adaptation notes

**For Sean Ingle (Guardian):**
- Twitter: @saboringle
- Angle: he covers Olympic politics extensively. Emphasize the CAS contrast — same court banned Heraskevych's memorial helmet but overturned the block on Russian qualification.

**For Nick Butler (Inside the Games):**
- Twitter: @NickButlerITG
- Angle: he is the most detailed Paralympic governance reporter. Emphasize the bilateral invitation mechanism and Rozhkov's escalating statements (2023 → 2024 → 2026).

**For BBC Sport:**
- Use the BBC news tip form or contact their Olympics desk
- Angle: UK government angle — Lisa Nandy called it "wrong" but the Bucha unit detail wasn't public when she commented.

**For Reuters / AP:**
- Wire services want verifiable facts. Lead with: "Suspilne identified 10 war veterans. RPC president claims 500. One served in unit linked to Bucha."
- They'll want to independently verify — point them to the Russian-language sources (TASS Saifullin interview, Paralymp.ru Bondarenko announcement, RIA Sport Geninov article).
