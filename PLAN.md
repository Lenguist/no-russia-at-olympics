# Campaign Plan: Reverse Russia's Reinstatement to 2026 Paralympics

## Situation (as of February 18, 2026)

- **Feb 17, 2026**: IPC confirmed 6 Russian + 4 Belarusian athletes will compete under national flags at Milano-Cortina 2026 Paralympics
- **Opening ceremony**: March 6, 2026 in Verona — **16 days from now**
- **Competition**: March 6-15, 2026 (para alpine skiing, para cross-country skiing, para snowboard)
- The decision is legally final (IPC General Assembly vote Sep 2025 + CAS ruling Dec 2025)
- This is the first time Russian flag/anthem appear since Sochi 2014

### Who opposes it already
- **Ukraine**: officials boycotting, Zelensky called it "dirty" and "unjust"
- **UK**: Sports Minister Lisa Nandy called it "completely the wrong decision"
- **EU**: Commissioner Glenn Micallef boycotting opening ceremony
- **35-country coalition** (incl. France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada, Italy) issued joint statement of concern
- **Estonia** called it a "disgrace"

### The explosive detail
Members of Russia's Paralympic delegation include **former combatants** who fought against Ukraine — battalion fighters, sappers, tank brigade members linked to war crimes. This is not just "athletes from a country at war" — these are people who personally participated in the invasion.

## What we learned from history

### What works (ranked by effectiveness)

| Tactic | Impact | Historical example |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| **Collective refusal by national teams** | Very high | 2022: Poland/Sweden/Czech refused to play Russia → FIFA reversed partial ban within 24 hours |
| **Documented evidence campaigns** | High | 2023-24: Ukrainian activists tracked Russian athletes' pro-war social media → IOC excluded athletes from Paris 2024 |
| **Coordinated government pressure** | High | 2022: 24-hour cascade of government statements forced IOC hand |
| **Media amplification with hard evidence** | High | McLaren Report on doping gave institutions cover to act |
| **Sponsor pressure** | Medium | Works when paired with media — sponsors escalate internally when tagged publicly |
| **Petitions** | Low alone | Only useful when paired with media + sponsor pressure to show scale |

### What doesn't work
| Tactic | Why it fails |
|--------|-------------|
| Sponsor boycott threats alone | Beijing 2022 — sponsors didn't withdraw despite congressional hearings |
| Diplomatic boycotts alone | No operational consequence, easily ignored |
| Emotional/nationalist framing | Sports bodies dismiss it, media won't amplify |
| Attacking disabled athletes personally | Immediately discredits the campaign |

### Key insight from 2022 Russia ban
The ban happened in **4 days** because national teams created an **operational crisis** — FIFA literally couldn't run the World Cup qualifiers if teams refused to play. Pure moral pressure alone has never reversed an IOC/IPC decision. You need to create **concrete consequences**.

---

## Strategic objective

**Primary goal**: Force IPC to strip national symbols (flag/anthem) and impose neutral status — returning to pre-September 2025 conditions.

**Secondary goal**: Build enough pressure that the precedent prevents full Russian team at LA 2028.

**Realistic assessment**: Full reversal of participation is unlikely in 16 days. Stripping flags/anthem is achievable. Damaging the normalization trajectory toward 2028 is very achievable.

---

## The campaign: three pressure tracks running simultaneously

### TRACK 1: Media & evidence (days 1-5)
**Goal**: Make the combatant-athletes story impossible to ignore.

The strongest asset is the documented profiles of Russian Paralympic team members who are former soldiers in the war against Ukraine. This is not widely reported in English-language media yet.

**Actions**:
1. Create a clean, sourced, English-language dossier of each combatant-athlete with:
   - Name, military unit, theater of operations
   - Specific war crimes linked to their units (e.g., 5th Guards Tank Brigade — Bucha/Kyiv region)
   - Sources (Russian media where they self-identified, Ukrainian investigative journalism)
2. Translate and verify the Ukrainian-language profiles from Suspilne (public broadcaster)
3. Package this as a press kit — send directly to:
   - Sports journalists: Tariq Panja (NYT), Sean Ingle (Guardian), Nick Butler (Inside the Games), Molly Solomon (NBC Olympics)
   - Investigative outlets: Bellingcat, OCCRP
   - European media: Deutsche Welle, France 24, BBC Sport
4. Post the dossier publicly (this repo → website) so journalists can reference it
5. Frame: **"The IPC is giving wild-card slots to soldiers who fought in the invasion of Ukraine"**

### TRACK 2: Sponsor pressure (days 1-10)
**Goal**: Make sponsors publicly distance themselves or privately pressure IPC.

**Priority targets** (consumer-facing, PR-sensitive):
1. **Visa** — Worldwide Paralympic Partner
2. **Coca-Cola** — Worldwide Paralympic Partner
3. **Samsung** — Worldwide Paralympic Partner
4. **Airbnb** — Worldwide Paralympic Partner
5. **Allianz** — Worldwide Paralympic Partner + Milano-Cortina local partner

**Secondary targets**:
6. Procter & Gamble
7. Deloitte
8. Ottobock (prosthetics company — especially relevant since they profit from disability while sponsoring event with war combatants)
9. Stellantis (Milano-Cortina vehicle partner — Italian, cares about EU opinion)
10. Leonardo (Italian aerospace — government contractor, sensitive to diplomatic pressure)

**Actions**:
1. Compile verified social media accounts and PR contact emails for each sponsor
2. Create template messages (calm, factual, question-based — not aggressive)
3. Coordinate public posts tagging sponsors on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram
4. Track and document sponsor responses (or silence)
5. Escalation: if no response in 3 days, send press inquiries to business journalists asking "Company X has not responded to questions about sponsoring event featuring war combatants"

**Message framework** (what works based on historical precedent):
> "@[Sponsor] — The 2026 Paralympics will feature athletes who served in Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, competing under the Russian flag. Does [Sponsor] support this? We'd welcome a public statement."

Short. Factual. Asks a question. Forces a response.

### TRACK 3: Institutional & government pressure (days 1-14)
**Goal**: Get more national Paralympic committees to publicly object or threaten consequences.

**Actions**:
1. Compile contact information for national Paralympic committees in allied countries
2. Draft template letters for citizens to send to:
   - Their national Paralympic committee
   - Their sports minister / ministry of sport
   - Their elected representatives (MPs, MEPs, Congress members)
3. Push for:
   - More countries joining the opening ceremony boycott
   - National committees issuing formal objections to IPC
   - Parliamentary questions / resolutions in EU Parliament, UK Parliament, US Congress
4. Coordinate with Ukrainian diaspora organizations (already mobilized)
5. Connect with existing sports ethics organizations

## What success looks like

**Best case (unlikely but possible)**:
- IPC reverses to neutral status (no flags/anthem) before March 6

**Good case (achievable)**:
- Multiple sponsors issue public statements distancing themselves
- Story of combatant-athletes becomes major international news
- Additional countries join ceremony boycott
- IPC faces enough pressure to affect LA 2028 decisions

**Minimum viable success**:
- Dossier enters the public record and media narrative
- Normalization of Russia in sport becomes politically costly
- Infrastructure exists for sustained pressure through 2028

---

## Principles

1. **Facts only** — every claim sourced, every translation verified
2. **No attacks on disability** — this is about war and state symbols, not disabled athletes
3. **Calm tone** — institutions dismiss emotional campaigns; they fear factual ones
4. **Ask questions, don't rant** — forces responses, creates accountability
5. **Coordinate, don't spam** — organized pressure beats volume
